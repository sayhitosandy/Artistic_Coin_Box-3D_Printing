### About
Our design showcases how we used a 3D modelling and repairing softwarer (TinkerCAD) and Slicing Sofware (Cura) to develop a:

1. Complex yet Compact,
2. Artistic yet Economical and
3. Portable yet Sturdy

coin box to help students like us to keep their change safe, at one place.

### Description
This coin box is in the shape of misaligned hexagons kept on top of one another, which gives it a cool shape. The coin box has a lid with opening to put coins. The lid has engravings of the team members as well.

### Technologies Used
Blender and TinkerCAD: 3D Modelling and Repairing

netfabb: Repairing

Cura: Design Slicing and Obtaining G-Code
